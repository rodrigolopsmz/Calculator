This is a basic calculator made with React, Css modules and Javscript. 
Building bundles files are made using Webpack, and using babel-loaders and css-loaders. 
Inside of dist folder there is an index.html and a bundle.js file. Download these files in the same folder and you will be able to use the calculator by opening the index.html file. 

To implement in the future:
* Keyboard listeners for numbers and math operators for the calculator
* Better styling of fonts and animations.
